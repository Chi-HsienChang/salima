  <h3>Thank you for visiting Salima's website!</h3>

  <p>

    I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php">Taiwan Evolutionary Intelligence Laboratory (TEILab)</a> advised by Dr.  <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php">Tian-Li Yu</a> 
    in <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php">Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php">National Taiwan University (NTU)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before joining TEILab, I did my Master's degree in Statistics at NTU 
    and my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics Sciences at the National Chengchi University.
    My research focuses on <b>developing theoretical support for model-based genetic algorithms</b>,
    aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical applications of these algorithms in solving complex optimization problems.  
  </p>

    I interned at the National Agricultural Library U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) in 2.2023-8.2023, where I worked on the project of <b>developing a machine learning model for predicting the crop yield</b>.
    Currently, I am interning at the National Institute of Informatics (NII) in 2.2024-4.2024, where I am working on the project of <b>developing a machine learning model for predicting the crop yield</b>.
    Next, I will be interning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 6.2024-5.2025, where I will be working on the project of <b>developing a machine learning model for predicting the crop yield</b>.


  

  <p>I will be glad to discuss research with you or hear any feedback you have. Please kindly send me an e-mail to <a>salimachchang@gmail.com</a>.
