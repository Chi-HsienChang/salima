    at MIT CSAIL advised by Dr. Boris Katz

    I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php">Taiwan Evolutionary Intelligence Laboratory (TEILab)</a> advised by Dr.  <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php">Tian-Li Yu</a> 
    in <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php">Electrical Engineering</a> Department at the <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php">National Taiwan University (NTU)</a>.
    
    Before joining TEILab, I did my Master's degree in the Statistics Department at NTU 
    and my Bachelor's degree in the Mathematics Sciences Department at the National Chengchi University.

  
    My research focuses on <b>enabling generalizations in human-AI/robot interactions</b> – 
    building robots that can generalize their learned models to robustly interact with humans
    in novel scenarios. Toward this vision, I develop machine learning models that
    provide robots with generalizable reasoning skills including <b>language understanding</b>
    and <b>social interactions</b>.
    You can find my papers on the <a class="go-publication" href="/?publication">publication page</a>.


    I am interested in Symbolic Regression, Genetic Programming, Machine Learning and Optimization Algorithm. In addition, I am familiar with and have been using R and Python programming languages for big data analysis and machine learning.
