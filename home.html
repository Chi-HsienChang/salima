  <h3>Thank you for visiting Salima's website!</h3>

  <p>

    I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://teilab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/#/home">Taiwan Evolutionary Intelligence Laboratory (TEILab)</a> advised by Dr.  <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=745">Tian-Li Yu</a> 
    in <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php">Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php">National Taiwan University (NTU)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before joining TEILab, I did my Master's degree in Statistics at NTU 
    and my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics Sciences at the National Chengchi University.
    My research focuses on <b>developing theoretical support for model-based genetic algorithms</b>,
    aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical applications of these algorithms in solving complex optimization problems.  
  </p>

  <p>
  From February to August 2023, I interned at the USDA, contributing to the development of a Linkout plugin for JBrowse 2 and a machine learning model for predicting images in insect databases using single nucleotide polymorphisms. 
  Recently, I have been interning at the NII from February to April 2024, focusing on generating molecular graphs through model-based genetic algorithms. 
  Subsequently, I will be a visiting student at MIT from June 2024 to May 2025, where I'll work on advancing fully interpretable simulators for pre-mRNA splicing.

  <p>I would be delighted to discuss research further or receive any feedback you might have. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at <a>salimachchang@gmail.com</a>.
